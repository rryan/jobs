# Engineer

[Wellframe](http://wellframe.com) is a Boston-based digital medicine company focused on building the next generation of infrastructure for clinical care delivery by combining artificial intelligence, medicine, and large scale computer systems. We're creating the first [real-world patient dataset](http://blog.wellframe.com/blog/predictive-analytics-uncovering-the-hidden-value-in-human-signals) and using it deliver personalized treatments, optimize the management of large patient populations, and dynamically organize healthcare resources around the needs of patients.

We are backed by the same set of investors who have backed ambitious companies like Tesla and SpaceX and are looking for engineers to join us in building the technology behind this mission. You will be creating technology that saves lives, influences the future of medicine and addresses major flaws in the US healthcare system. If you are talented, driven, and hungry for a challenge, weâ€™d love to hear from you. If you are interested in learning more, please shoot an email to vinnie@wellframe.com 


### Sample Projects
* Design and implement a programming language for doctors to manipulate and specify thereapeutic regimens. What kind of type system would you put in place?
* Build a compiler for your clinical programming language.
* Integrate with and extract insights from Electronic Medical Records, Insurance Records, wireless blood glucose scales, and more. 
* Build a data pipeline on top of Spark to analyze populations of hundreds of thousands of patients and discover new computational biomarkers. 

### Our Ideal Candidate

You'll fit in at Wellframe if you:
* Learn quickly and work best in complex environments. Healthcare is messy. You'll need to pick up human biology, clinical medicine, and healthcare policy to thrive and innovate. 
* Can build secure, fault-tolerant, and scalable distributed software systems.
* Know how to pick the right tool for the job - Java, C++, Haskell, Ruby. If you don't know it, you're excited to learn. 
* Are excited about working with a team of scientists, clinicians, and other engineers to rebuild healthcare from the ground up.
* Have **never** worked in healthcare before.
